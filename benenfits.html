      <p class="mt-1" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 400;text-align: justify;">
        We understand the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions and make our environment cleaner to ensure a better climate for all to live in. The SHAKARZAHI Micro-power constant energy system provides net zero carbon emissions in both the generation process and power distribution. The device does not produce any pollution or carbon dioxide emissions, making it eligible for a safer form of electricity.
        <br><br>


        President Joe Biden reported a zero-carbon policy in his bid to achieve a net zero-carbon economy by the year 2050. Embracing this policy is the right approach to freeing our environment from all the carbon footprints we acquire daily through our continued use of gas, coal, and fossil fuels. Our device can make achieving the policy easy because it ensures no carbon emission or pollution that can harm our climate. The device is suitable for homes, businesses, electric cars, trucks, and buses.
